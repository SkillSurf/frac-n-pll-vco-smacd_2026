# A 2.4 GHz LC-VCO Fractional-N Phase Locked Loop Open-Source Design in 130nm BiCMOS

## Introduction

This work represents the **first RF integrated circuit design paper from the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering (ENTC), University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka**, highlighting the department's growing strength in open-source semiconductor design and advanced wireless communication systems.

Radio frequency (RF) integrated circuit design using open-source tools has traditionally been limited by the absence of reliable passive device models, particularly for on-chip spiral inductors. Consequently, prior open-source RF designs rely on ring-oscillator-based voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs) with degraded phase noise performance, limiting their applicability in demanding wireless communication standards. This research addresses these challenges by developing a complete, fully open-source 2.4 GHz fractional-N PLL design in the IHP SG13G2 130nm BiCMOS technology, demonstrating that high-performance RF circuits can be achieved entirely within the open-source CMOS design ecosystem.

# Abstract

Radio frequency (RF) integrated circuit design using the open-source complementary Metal-Oxide semiconductor (CMOS) ecosystem, such as for phase-locked loops (PLLs), is limited by the absence of reliable passive device models, particularly on-chip spiral inductors. Consequently, prior work relies on ring-oscillator-based voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs) with degraded phase noise performance. This work presents a 2.4 GHz type-II fractional-N PLL implemented in the IHP SG13G2 130nm BiCMOS open-source technology. The proposed design employs a cross-coupled differential LC-VCO integrated with a custom-designed spiral inductor, developed using an open-source electromagnetic modelling workflow in OpenEMS. The optimized inductor achieves 4 nH inductance with a quality factor of 16.8 at 2.45 GHz. The LC-VCO sensitivity is approximately 120 MHz/V while the PLL phase noise is -100.8 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset. The complete PLL is realized using a fully open-source electronic design automation (EDA) flow, occupying a total area of 660 μm × 526.5 μm (≈ 0.347 mm²) and consuming 12.73 mW, demonstrating the feasibility of RF integrated circuit design in an open-source CMOS IC design ecosystem.
